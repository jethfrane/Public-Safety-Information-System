          <h4>History</h4>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The passage into law on December 13, 1990 of Republic Act No. 6975
            entitled “An Act Establishing the Philippine National Police under a
            reorganized Department of the Interior and Local Government and
            Other Purposes” ended the existence of the Philippine Constabulary
            and the Integrated National Police and gave way to the creation of
            the Philippine National Police, now known as the country's police
            force that is national in scope and civilian in character. It is
            administered and controlled by the National Police Commission.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            With the effectivity of Republic Act No. 8551, otherwise known as
            the “Philippine National Police Reform and Reorganization Act of
            1998,” the PNP was envisioned to be a community and service-oriented
            Agency. As mandated by law, the PNP activated/created the Internal
            Affairs Service (IAS) on a national scope on June 1, 1999. It is an
            organization within the structure of the PNP and one of its tasks is
            to help the Chief, PNP institute reforms to improve the image of the
            police force through assessment, analysis and evaluation of the
            character and behavior of the PNP Personnel. It is headed by the
            Inspector General.
