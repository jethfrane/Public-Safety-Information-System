          <h4>History</h4>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The BFP was formed from the units of the Integrated National
            Police's Office of Fire Protection Service on January 29, 1991
            through Republic Act No. 6975, which created the present Interior
            Department and placed the provision of fire services under its
            control.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Republic Act No. 6975, or the Department of Interior and Local
            Government Act of 1990, took effect on January 1, 1991 and paved the
            way for the establishment of the Philippine National Police, BFP and
            Bureau of Jail Management and Penology as separate entities.
            Specifically, the Fire Bureau's charter was created under Chapter IV
            (Section 53 to 59) and carried-out through the provisions of Rule
            VII (Sections 49 to 58) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of
            the act. The organization was then placed under the direct
            supervision of the DILG undersecretary for peace and order. The
            Appropriation Act of 1991 also caused the inaugural operation of the
            BFP on August 2, 1991 as a distinct agency of the government, with
            the initial preparation of its operation plans and budget (OPB)
            undertaken by the staff of the Office of the National Chief Fire
            Marshal at Camp Crame, Quezon City headed by F/Brigadier General
            Ernesto Madriaga, INP (1990-1992), which took over from the long
            reign of F/Major Primo D. Cordeta (Ret.), the first chief fire
            marshal (1978-1989). Madriaga served as the BFP's first acting fire
            chief/director from 1991 to 1992.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            In 2021, Republic Act No.11589, or the BFP Modernization Act, was
            enacted into law, mandating the implementation of a ten-year program
            to modernize the BFP. The law also enabled the creation of security
            and protection units (SPUs) in each regional and city fire station
            and allowed 14 members at most per SPU to bare firearms.
