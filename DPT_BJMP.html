          <h4>History and Overview</h4>
          <br/>
          <p>
            On January 2, 1991, the was created thru Republic Act 6975 as a line
            Bureau under the Department of Interior and Local Government. The
            Jail Bureau is the upgraded version of its forerunner, the Office of
            Jail Management and Penology of the defunct PC/INP last headed by
            BRIG GEN Arsenio E. Concepcion.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            As mandated by law, the BJMP shall operate under the reorganized
            Department of the Interior and Local Government.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Starting from scratch with 500 personnel in 1991 the BJMP weaned
            from its mother PC/INP as a mere component, to become a full-fledged
            bureau. Director Charles S. Mondejar took his oath of office on July
            1 of 1991 as the first Chief of the Bureau.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology supervises and controls
            all district, city and municipal jails.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            - As one of the five pillars of the Criminal Justice System, the
            BJMP was created to address growing concern of jail management and
            penology problem. Primarily, its clients are detainees accused
            before a court who are temporarily confined in such jails while
            undergoing investigation, waiting final judgement and those who are
            serving sentence promulgated by the court 3 years and below. As
            provided for under R.A. No. 6975, the Jail Bureau is mandated to
            take operational and administrative control over all city, district
            and municipal jails. The Bureau has four major areas of
            rehabilitation program, namely: Livelihood Projects, Educational and
            Vocational Training, Recreation and Sports, and Religious/ Spiritual
            Activities. These were continuously implemented to eliminate the
            offenders' pattern of criminal behaviors and to reform them to
            become law-abiding and productive citizens. Although the workplace
            of the Jail Bureau is confined inside the portals of jail to
            safeguard PDL, nonetheless, the Bureau has an inherent function of
            informing the public of jail operations and other matters concerning
            the corrections pillar of the Philippines. Coincidentally, being a
            new and growing Bureau, BJMP aims to keep the public abreast of
            information regarding jail management and penology.
