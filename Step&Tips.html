                    <h2>Prevention for a Stopped Heart</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>If you think someone is in cardiac arrest, there are four steps you can take to help them.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say: “Call 911.”</li>
                        <li>Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person's chest. Let their chest come back up naturally between compressions. Keep going until someone with more training arrives.</li>
                        <li>If you're trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing.</li>
                        <li>If it's available, use an AED. However, do not put off doing chest compressions to go look for an AED. If possible, instruct someone else to go find the device and bring it to you.</li>
                    </ol><br><br>

                    <h2>Prevention for Bleeding</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>If someone is injured and bleeding, there are a few basics about how blood works that will be helpful for you to know.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash your hands or put on disposable gloves if you have them. This will protect you from infectious diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS that can be spread in a person's blood</li>
                        <li>Rinse the wound with water.</li>
                        <li>Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (e.g., towel, blanket, clothing).</li>
                        <li>Apply direct pressure to stop the flow of blood and encourage clotting (when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss).</li>
                        <li>Elevate the bleeding body part above the person's head if you can.</li>
                        <li>Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.</li>
                        <li>Once bleeding has stopped, put a clean bandage on the wound.</li>
                    </ol><br><br>

                    <h2>Prevention for Choking</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>If someone is choking, you should know how to use the Heimlich maneuver.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward.</li>
                        <li>Put your arms around their waist.</li>
                        <li>Clench your fist and place it between their belly button (navel) and rib cage.</li>
                        <li>Grab your fist with your other hand.</li>
                        <li>Pull your clenched fist sharply backward and upward under the person's rib cage in 5 quick thrusts.</li>
                        <li>Repeat until the object is coughed up.</li>
                    </ol><br><br>

                    <h2>Prevention for Burns</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>Major burns need emergency medical attention. Once you've stopped the burning process, call 911 or get someone else to.</p>
                    <p>For burns that are not an emergency, you can take these first aid steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. Do not use ice.</li>
                        <li>Apply a light gauze bandage. If the burn is minor, you can put on an ointment, like aloe vera, before you cover it.</li>
                        <li>Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief if you need it.</li>
                        <li>Do not break any blisters that form.</li>
                    </ol><br><br>

                    <h2>Prevention for Blisters</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>If the blister is small, not open, and doesn't hurt, it's best to leave it alone. You can cover it to prevent rubbing, which could cause it to swell and burst.</p>
                    <p>Do not pop a blister, as this could let bacteria get inside it and cause an infection.</p>
                    <p>If the blister is big or painful, you need to take different steps to treat it.</p>
                    <p>Here are the first aid steps to take for a more serious blister:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash your hands.</li>
                        <li>Sterilize a needle with alcohol.</li>
                        <li>Make small holes at the edge of the blister.</li>
                        <li>Gently push out the fluid.</li>
                        <li>Apply antibiotic ointment.</li>
                        <li>Put on a bandage.</li>
                        <li>If possible, take steps to protect the area from further rubbing or pressure.</li>

                    <h2>Prevention for a Broken Bone or Fracture</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>In some cases, you will need emergency medical care to deal with a broken bone.</p>
                    <p>Call 911 if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The person is bleeding a lot, is unresponsive, is not breathing, or has more than one injury</li>
                        <li>You think a person has a fracture or other serious injury in their spinal column, head, hip, pelvis, or thigh. In this case, do not move the person.</li>
                        <li>A broken bone is poking through the skin (open or compound fracture)</li>
                        <li>The area below an injured joint feels cold and clammy or looks bluish</li>
                        <li>You cannot keep the injury from moving well enough to transport the person</li>
                    </ul><br><br>

                    <h2>Prevention for Sprains</h2>
                    <h3>What To Do</h3>
                    <p>The first thing to do is make sure that the injured person stops any unnecessary activity, as moving can make the injury worse.</p>
                    <p>Sprains often don't require emergency treatment. However, you should get immediate medical care if the injured person:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Has severe pain when they move or are touched</li>
                        <li>Cannot put any weight on the injured joint</li>
                        <li>Has increased bruising</li>
                        <li>Has numbness or pins-and-needles near the sprain</li>
                        <li>Shows signs of infection</li>
                        <li>Has little or no improvement during the first week after the injury happens</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>If emergency care is not needed, follow these first aid steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep the limb as still as possible.</li>
                        <li>Apply a cold pack.</li>
                        <li>Elevate the injured part if you can do so safely.</li>
                        <li>Use NSAIDs for pain.</li>
                        <li>Ask your provider about any other treatment for a sprain you might need.</li>

                    <p>First aid for a nosebleed has a few simple steps.</p>
                    <p>If your nose is bleeding:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lean slightly forward, not back.</li>
                        <li>Pinch your nose just below the bridge. It needs to be high enough that the nostrils are not pinched closed.</li>
                        <li>After five minutes, check to see if the bleeding has stopped. If not, continue pinching and check after another 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Apply a cold pack to the bridge of your nose while you're pinching.</li>

                <div id="crowded">
                    <h2>Attacks in Crowded and Public Spaces:</h2>
                    <p>Take steps to prepare and protect yourself and help others in the event of a mass attack.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Mass Attacks</h3>
                    <p>Individuals using firearms to cause mass casualties (active shooter).</p>
                    <p>Individuals using a vehicle to cause mass casualties.</p>
                    <p>Individuals using homemade bombs to cause mass casualties.</p>
                    <p>Other methods used in mass attacks may include knives, fires, drones or other weapons.</p>
                    <h3>Prepare BEFORE</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay alert. Always be aware of your environment and any possible dangers.</li>
                        <li>If you see something, say something® to local authorities. That includes suspicious packages, people behaving strangely or someone using strange communications.</li>
                        <li>Observe warning signs. Signs might include unusual or violent communications, substance abuse, expressed anger or intent to cause harm. These warning signs may increase over time.</li>
                        <li>Have an exit plan. Identify exits and areas to hide wherever you go, including work, school and special events.</li>
                        <li>Learn lifesaving skills. Take trainings such as You Are the Help Until Help Arrives and first aid to assist the wounded before help arrives.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Run to Safety</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seek safety. Getting away from the attacker is the top priority.</li>
                        <li>Leave your belongings behind and get away.</li>
                        <li>Call Emergency hot-line when you are safe and describe the attacker, location and weapons.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover and hide if you can't evacuate. Find a place to hide out of view of the attacker and put a solid barrier between yourself and the threat if possible.</li>
                        <li>Lock and block doors, close blinds and turn off lights.</li>
                        <li>Keep silent.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fight only as a last resort. When you can't run or cover, attempt to disrupt the attack or disable the attacker.</li>
                        <li>Be aggressive and commit to your actions.</li>
                        <li>Recruit others to ambush the attacker with makeshift weapons such as chairs, fire extinguishers, scissors, books, etc.</li>
                        <li>Be prepared to cause severe or lethal injury to the attacker.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Help the Wounded</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take care of yourself first and then, if you are able, help the wounded get to safety and provide immediate care. Emergency hotline when it is safe for you to do so.</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
                    <p>Prepare Before an Earthquake</p>
                    <h3>The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with family and coworkers.</li>
                        <li>Make an Emergency Plan: Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated. Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for several days, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher and a whistle.</li>
                        <li>Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home, alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.</li>
                        <li>Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford it, make essential purchases and slowly build up supplies.</li>
                        <li>Protect Your Home: Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, water heaters, televisions and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.</li>
                        <li>Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural issues that could cause your building to collapse during an earthquake.</li>
                        <li>Consider obtaining an earthquake insurance policy. A standard homeowner's insurance policy does not cover earthquake damage.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Stay Safe During</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If an earthquake happens, protect yourself right away:</li>
                        <li>If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.</li>
                        <li>If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.</li>
                        <li>If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.</li>
                        <li>If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Protect Yourself During Earthquakes</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Drop (or Lock)</strong></li>
                        <p>Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. If you're using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.</p>
                        <li><strong>Cover</strong></li>
                        <p>Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it for shelter. If no shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows). Crawl only if you can reach better cover without going through an area with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to protect vital organs.</p>
                        <li><strong>Hold On</strong></li>
                        <p>If you are under a table or desk, hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves. If seated and unable to drop to the floor, bend forward, cover your head with your arms and hold on to your neck with both hands.</p>
                    </ol><br>
                    <h3>There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel an aftershock.</li>
                        <li>If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. Do not enter damaged buildings.</li>
                        <li>If you are trapped, send a text or bang on a pipe or wall. Cover your mouth with your shirt for protection and instead of shouting, use a whistle.</li>
                        <li>If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the shaking stops. Avoid contact with floodwaters as they can contain chemicals, sewage, and debris.</li>
                        <li>Check yourself to see if you are hurt and help others if you have training. Learn how to be the help until help arrives.</li>
                    </ul><br><br><br>

                    <h2>Home Fires</h2>
                    <p>A fire can become life-threatening in just two minutes. A residence can be engulfed in flames in five minutes.</p>
                    <h3>Learn About Fires</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fire is FAST! In less than 30 seconds a small flame can turn into a major fire. It only takes minutes for thick black smoke to fill a house or for it to be engulfed in flames.</li>
                        <li>Fire is HOT! Heat is more threatening than flames. Room temperatures in a fire can be 100 degrees at floor level and rise to 600 degrees at eye level. Inhaling this super-hot air will scorch your lungs and melt clothes to your skin.</li>
                        <li>Fire is DARK! Fire starts bright, but quickly produces black smoke and complete darkness.</li>
                        <li>Fire is DEADLY! Smoke and toxic gases kill more people than flames do. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Before a Fire</h3>
                        <p>If you are insured, contact your insurance company for detailed instructions on protecting your property, conducting inventory and contacting fire damage restoration companies.</p><br>
                    <h3>Create and Practice a Fire Escape Plan</h3>
                        <p>Remember that every second counts in the event of a fire. Escape plans help you get out of your home quickly. Practice your home fire escape plan twice each year. Some tips to consider when preparing this plan include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find two ways to get out of each room in the event the primary way is blocked by fire or smoke.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that windows are not stuck, screens can be taken out quickly and that security bars can be properly opened.</li>
                        <li>Practice feeling your way out of the house in the dark or with your eyes closed.</li>
                        <li>Teach children not to hide from firefighters.</li>
                        <li>If you use a walker or wheelchair, check all exits to be sure you can get through the doorways.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Fire Safety Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make digital copies of valuable documents and records like birth certificates.</li>
                        <li>Sleep with your bedroom door closed.</li>
                        <li>Keep a fire extinguisher in your kitchen. Contact your local fire department for assistance on proper use and maintenance.</li>
                        <li>Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>During a Fire</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drop down to the floor and crawl low, under any smoke to your exit. Heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling.</li>
                        <li>Before opening a door, feel the doorknob and door. If either is hot, or if there is smoke coming around the door, leave the door closed and use your second way out.</li>
                        <li>If you open a door, open it slowly. Be ready to shut it quickly if heavy smoke or fire is present..</li>
                        <li>If you can't get to someone needing assistance, leave the home and call 9-1-1 or the fire department. Tell the emergency operator where the person is located.</li>
                        <li>If pets are trapped inside your home, tell firefighters right away.</li>
                        <li>If you can't get out, close the door and cover vents and cracks around doors with cloth or tape to keep smoke out. Call Emergency hotline or your fire department. Say where you are and signal for help at the window with a light-colored cloth or a flashlight.</li>
                        <li>If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop and roll - stop immediately, drop to the ground and cover your face with your hands. Roll over and over or back and forth until the fire is out. If you or someone else cannot stop, drop and roll, smother the flames with a blanket or towel. Use cool water to treat the burn immediately for three to five minutes. Cover with a clean, dry cloth. Get medical help right away by calling emergency hotline or the fire department.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>After a Fire</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact your local disaster relief service, such as The Red Cross, if you need temporary housing, food and medicines.</li>
                        <li>Check with the fire department to make sure your residence is safe to enter.</li>
                        <li>DO NOT attempt to reconnect utilities yourself. The fire department should make sure that utilities are either safe to use or are disconnected before they leave the site. </li>
                        <li>Conduct an inventory of damaged property and items. Do not throw away any damaged goods until after you make the inventory of your items.</li>
                        <li>Begin saving receipts for any money you spend related to fire loss. The receipts may be needed later by the insurance company and for verifying losses claimed on your income tax.</li>
                        <li>Notify your mortgage company of the fire.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Prevent Home Fires</h3>
                    <p>Home fires can be preventable. The following are simple steps that each of us can take to prevent a tragedy.</p>
                    <h3>Cooking</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay in the kitchen when you are frying, grilling or broiling food. Turn off the stove if you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time.</li>
                        <li>Wear short, close-fitting or tightly rolled sleeves when cooking.</li>
                        <li>Position barbecue grills at least 10 feet away from siding and deck railings, and out from under eaves and overhanging branches.</li>
                        <li>Keep a fire extinguisher available.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Electrical and Appliance Safety</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frayed wires can cause fires. Replace all worn, old or damaged appliance cords immediately and do not run cords under rugs or furniture.</li>
                        <li>If an appliance has a three-prong plug, use it only in a three-slot outlet. Never force it to fit into a two-slot outlet or extension cord.</li>
                        <li>Immediately shut off, then professionally replace, light switches that are hot to the touch and lights that flicker.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Keeping Children Safe</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take the mystery out of fire play by teaching children that fire is a tool, not a toy.</li>
                        <li>Store matches and lighters out of children's reach and sight, preferably in a locked cabinet.</li>
                        <li>Never leave children unattended near operating stoves or burning candles, even for a short time.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>More Fire Prevention Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never use a stove range or oven to heat your home.</li>
                        <li>Keep combustible and flammable liquids away from heat sources.</li>
                        <li>Portable generators should NEVER be used indoors and should only be refueled outdoors and in well ventilated areas.</li>

                    <h2>Floods</h2>
                    <p>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.</p>
                    <h3>Floods may:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges and overflows of dams and other water systems.</li>
                        <li>Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.</li>
                        <li>Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings and create landslides.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>If you are under a flood warning:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find safe shelter right away.</li>
                        <li>Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don't Drown!</li>
                        <li>Remember, just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</li>
                        <li>Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.</li>
                        <li>Depending on the type of flooding:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Evacuate if told to do so.</li>
                                <li>Move to higher ground or a higher floor.</li>
                                <li>Stay where you are.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul><br> 
                    <h3>Staying Safe During a Flood</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evacuate immediately, if told to evacuate. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.</li>
                        <li>Contact your healthcare provider If you are sick and need medical attention. Wait for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call emergency hotline.</li>
                        <li>Listen to Radio or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions regarding flooding.</li>
                        <li>Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don't Drown!</li>
                        <li>Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.</li>
                        <li>Stay inside your car if it is trapped in rapidly moving water. Get on the roof if water is rising inside the car.</li>
                        <li>Get to the highest level if trapped in a building. Only get on the roof if necessary and once their signal for help. Do not climb into a closed attic to avoid getting trapped by rising floodwater.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>Staying Safe After a Flood</h3>

                        <li>Pay attention to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.</li>
                        <li>Avoid driving except in emergencies.</li>
                        <li>People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that snakes and other animals may be in your house.</li>
                        <li>Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. Turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock if it is safe to do so.</li>
                        <li>Avoid wading in floodwater, which can be contaminated and contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.</li>
                        <li>Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.</li>

                    <h2>Pandemics</h2>
                    <p>A pandemic is a disease outbreak that spans several countries and affects a large number of people. Pandemics are most often caused by viruses, like Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can easily spread from person to person.</p>
                    <p>A new virus, like COVID-19, can emerge from anywhere and quickly spread around the world. It is hard to predict when or where the next new pandemic will emerge.</p>
                    <h3>If a Pandemic is declared:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
                        <li>Keep a distance of at least six feet between yourself and people who are not part of your household.</li>
                        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when in public.</li>
                        <li>Clean and disinfect high-touch objects and surfaces.</li>
                        <li>Stay at home as much as possible to prevent the spread of disease.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>How to Prepare Yourself for a Pandemic</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn how diseases spread to help protect yourself and others. Viruses can be spread from person to person, from a non-living object to a person and by people who are infected but don't have any symptoms.</li>
                        <li>Prepare for the possibility of schools, workplaces and community centers being closed. Investigate and prepare for virtual coordination for school, work (telework) and social activities.</li>
                        <li>Gather supplies in case you need to stay home for several days or weeks. Supplies may include cleaning supplies, non-perishable foods, prescriptions and bottled water. Buy supplies slowly to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to buy what they need.</li>
                        <li>Create an emergency plan so that you and your family know what to do and what you will need in case an outbreak happens. Consider how a pandemic may affect your plans for other emergencies.</li>
                        <li>Review your health insurance policies to understand what they cover, including telemedicine options.</li>
                        <li>Create password-protected digital copies of important documents and store in a safe place. Watch out for scams and fraud.</li>

                    <p><strong>Get vaccinated.</strong> Vaccines stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies, so vaccines actually prevent diseases.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take actions to prevent the spread of disease. Cover coughs and sneezes. Wear a mask in public. Stay home when sick (except to get medical care). Disinfect surfaces. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Stay six feet away from people who are not part of your household.</li>
                        <li>If you believe you've been exposed to the disease, contact your doctor, follow the quarantine instructions from medical providers and monitor your symptoms. If you're experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 and shelter in place with a mask, if possible, until help arrives.</li>
                        <li>Share accurate information about the disease with friends, family and people on social media. Sharing bad information about the disease or treatments for the disease may have serious health outcomes. Remember that stigma hurts everyone and can cause discrimination against people, places or nations.</li>
                        <li>Know that it's normal to feel anxious or stressed. Engage virtually with your community through video and phone calls. Take care of your body and talk to someone if you are feeling upset.</li>
