          <h4>History</h4>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Prior to building the CDH, AMSI had already been managing the CDH
            Satellite Clinic located at Crossing, Calamba. The operational
            experience gained in managing the said clinic assisted AMSI in
            assessing the needs and wants of the residents in the area in terms
            of medical and hospitalization services. Thus, the founding members
            and incorporators of the corporation pursued the desire to establish
            CDH. Subsequently, upon the formal registration of the corporation
            with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 1993,
            additional investors who were not directly involved in the health
            sector had been recruited and who actively involved themselves in
            charting the course of AMSI's future. In 1996, AMSI-CDH established
            a sister company, the CALAMBA DIAGNOSTICS, INC. (CDI) to manage the
            Cardio-Pulmonary Services of the hospital and to offer high-tech
            medical diagnostic services to its patients. By the end of 1999, CDH
            has successfully offered CT-Scan services, general ultrasound and
            2-D Echocardiography, EEG, among others.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            However, the AMSI Board of Directors deemed it wise to merge CDI
            with AMSI and create a Cardio-Pulmonary Department under CDH
            management. Thus, a plan of merger between the two corporations was
            registered with the SEC on August 29, 2002.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Likewise, in 2002, the LAGUNA MRI CENTER, INC. (LMCI), a sister
            corporation of AMSI which is spearheaded by a consortium of hospital
            owners, the majority investment of which, came from AMSI, was
            established and gave CDH an edge as compared to other hospitals, in
            terms of a more advanced diagnostic imaging services.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            From then on, long term plans which include lateral and vertical
            expansion of the physical plant, acquisition of state-of-the-art
            diagnostic equipment and a roster of highly qualified medical staff,
            were slowly but surely realized. Further, the facility has been
            tapped as the base hospital for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing
            (BSN) students of Calamba Doctors' College, which is partly owned by
            AMSI.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Indeed, the Calamba Doctors' Hospital is one of the most favored
            health care facilities not only on the province of Laguna, but also
            in Batangas and Cavite.
